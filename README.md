# react-image-randomizer
Created with CodeSandbox

This is a quick flex of my (lightwieght) React muscles - a game where you try to keep track of 9 metal album covers.

When you click on one image, the srcs of all the other images are randomized, and if you click on one that you've already clicked, you lose!

This app is infinitely scalable (within reason), as you could just feed it new album srcs and Image components until you make yourself sick.
